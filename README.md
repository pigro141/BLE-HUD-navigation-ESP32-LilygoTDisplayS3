## ðŸš€ Overview

A Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) Heads-Up Display (HUD) for the **LilyGO T-Display-S3**, showing real-time navigation directions, speed, voltage, and connection status. This project is based on the work of [Alexander Lavrushko](https://github.com/alexanderlavrushko/BLE-HUD-navigation-ESP32) and adapted specifically for the LilyGO T-Display-S3 platform.

## ðŸ›  Hardware Requirements

* **ESP32** SoC (LilyGO T-Display-S3 integrates this)
* **TFT Display** - Integrated 1.9" ST7789 (on LilyGO T-Display-S3)
* Optional: Voltage divider for battery monitoring

## ðŸ“² Compatible Mobile App

Currently supported on iOS via **Sygic GPS Navigation & Maps**: [Download](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/sygic-gps-navigation-maps/id585193266)

### ðŸ”“ How to Enable BLE HUD Feature in the App

1. Open app: Menu â†’ Settings â†’ Info â†’ About
2. Tap 3 times on any item to unlock hidden menu
3. Navigate: About â†’ BLE HUD â†’ Start
4. Grant Bluetooth permission

> Notes:
>
> * BLE HUD must be re-enabled after each app restart
> * Works only in foreground
> * "No route" may briefly appear when recalculating navigation

## ðŸ”§ Setup & Installation

### Prerequisites

* Arduino IDE with ESP32 board support
* Clone this repo or download the `.ino` sketch

### Libraries Required

* `TFT_eSPI` (configured for LilyGO)
* `BLEDevice`, `BLEServer`, `BLEUtils`, `BLE2902` (included with ESP32 core)

### LilyGO TFT Configuration

Use the official LilyGO fork for correct `TFT_eSPI` config:
[https://github.com/Xinyuan-LilyGO/T-Display-S3](https://github.com/Xinyuan-LilyGO/T-Display-S3)

Ensure you use `User_Setups/SetupXX_TDisplay_S3.h` or configure `User_Setup.h` accordingly.

### Flash Instructions

1. Select board: `ESP32 Dev Module` or `T-Display-S3`
2. Select correct port
3. Upload the sketch via Arduino IDE

## ðŸ“¡ BLE Communication Protocol

The ESP32 expects navigation data in this format:

```json
[1, <speed>, <direction>, <message>]
```

* `speed`: uint8 (0â€“255 km/h)
* `direction`: Enum (see `DirectionConstants.h`)
* `message`: Null-terminated string

---

## ðŸ’» Usage

1. Power on device
2. Wait for BLE connection from Sygic app
3. HUD displays directions and speed automatically
4. Enter deep sleep via long press (if enabled)
